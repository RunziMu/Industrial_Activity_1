    <h1> Uses of CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology for web development that allows you to control the
        visual appearance and layout of HTML elements. Here are some reasons why CSS is commonly used: </p>

    <p>1. Separation of Concerns: CSS separates the presentation layer (styling and layout) from the structure and
        content of a web page. This separation makes it easier to manage and update the visual aspects of a website
        without modifying the underlying HTML structure.</p>
    <p> 2. Consistency and Efficiency: CSS enables you to define styles once and apply them to multiple elements
        throughout your website. This promotes consistency in design, reduces redundancy, and makes maintenance more
        efficient.</p>
    <p> 3. Flexibility and Control: CSS offers extensive control over various aspects of web design, such as colors,
        fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness. With CSS, you can create intricate layouts, implement
        responsive designs, and adapt the appearance of a website for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
    <p> 4. Accessibility: CSS provides features that enhance web accessibility. You can use CSS to define proper color
        contrast, provide visual cues for navigation, optimize content for screen readers, and improve overall user
        experience for people with disabilities.</p>
